# The Generous Garden

This site was created as part of an assignment to draw inspiration from a Dribble mock-up and recreate it. My focus for this assingment was to understand and work with flexbox. Overall, this assignment was a step forward for me in bringing my ideas to the web and I'm excited to work with flexbox more in the near future.

Note: this site is not yet fully responsive.
